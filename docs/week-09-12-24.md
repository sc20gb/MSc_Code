**Date**: 2024-12-09 to 2024-12-13

## Overview
The code reposetorie was refactored to be inline with standard pratices. The current configuration was tested to ensure that the MLLM was training as intended within both training steps:

</div>

As the training of the projecting module does not improve the loss in a significant or relable mannor an evaluation of the training protocol needs to be conducted.

Dispite this the second training step is still succsesful and a further gain on performance has been made:

Following the cohort tutorials intial aims, objectives, and research questions have been outlined.

## Accomplishments

- Code Refactoring and cleaning
- Improved the MLLM performance
- Started an AIMs and Objectives

## Plans for Next Week

- Get some results/ a working model with the new MLLM model

- Catchup on paper reading
