# Week Progress

**Date**: 2024-11-18 to 2024-11-22

## Overview

Due to the computational requirements of using Vicuna-13b a smaller model TinyLama was implemented. However the smaller model was incompatible with the existing autoregressive generation function. In order to preserve the compatibility of future LamaModels the selective parts of the transformers library have been overwritten (see the utils folder), allowing the original generation function to be used.

The TinyLama paper can be found here:

## Accomplishments

- Implemented a more efficient MLLM class by modifying the transformers library.

- Created more efficient versions to fine tune the new MLLM class.

- Tested the MLLM class to be compatible with all models used so far: Vicuna-13b, Vicuna-7b, and TinyLama.
