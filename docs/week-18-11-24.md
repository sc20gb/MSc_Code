# Week Progress

**Date**: 2024-11-18 to 2024-11-22

## Overview

Due to the computational requirements of using Vicuna-13b a smaller model TinyLama was implemented. However the smaller model was incompatible with the existing autoregressive generation function. In order to preserve the compatibility of future LamaModels the selective parts of the transformers library have been overwritten (see the utils folder), allowing the original generation function to be used.


## Accomplishments

- Implemented a more efficient MLLM class by modifying the transformers library.


## Challenges

-
